(4) Build in buffer time Friday afternoon for unexpected issues. (5) Don't skip breaks - they're essential for sustained performance. (6) Stay hydrated and maintain regular meals. (7) If feeling overwhelmed, reach out to professors about assignment extensions BEFORE Friday. (8) Consider forming a quick study group for DBMS Tuesday evening for collaborative problem-solving.

(4) Build in buffer time Friday afternoon for unexpected issues. (5) Don't skip breaks - they're essential for sustained performance. (6) Stay hydrated and maintain regular meals. (7) If feeling overwhelmed, reach out to professors about assignment extensions BEFORE Friday. (8) Consider forming a quick study group for DBMS Tuesday evening for collaborative problem-solving.
